Hi, welcome to my corner of the web! If you want to get in touch, send me an email at [morgan@morgangallant.com](mailto:morgan@morgangallant.com)! I try to respond to every email; most of my closest friends came from the internet :)

By day, I lead full-text search efforts at [turbopuffer](https://turbopuffer.com). This is a pretty broad role, but I generally spend most of my time working on the database itself and talking to customers. On nights and weekends, I usually spend a bit of time working on projects for my software studio, [The Lovely Software Corp](https://lovely.software).

In the past, I:

- Started [Operand](https://operand.ai) with [Xander](https://x.com/donwauchopex) in early 2021; we worked on infrastructure for proactive software. Shut it down in late 2023.
- Worked on GPU tooling at [AMD](https://amd.com/) in 2020; built the [FidelityFX Downsampler](https://gpuopen.com/fidelityfx-spd/) and hacked on [real-time audio denoising](https://www.amd.com/en/products/software/adrenalin/amd-noise-suppression.html).
- Did platform engineering (firmware and infrastructure) for [Kuna](https://getkuna.com/) in 2019. I built [on-device object detection](https://getkuna.com/pages/kuna-ai) and real-time audio/video streaming.
- Researched query expansion techniques for information retrieval at the [Queen's](https://www.queensu.ca/) [BAM Lab](https://research.cs.queensu.ca/home/farhana/bam-lab/) in 2018, and [published at COMPSAC 2019](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8754179).

Outside of tech, I enjoy reading, hanging out with friends, making coffee, taking photos and going on long walks! I live in Vancouver, Canada â€” especially during the summer, it's a beautiful place to be.
